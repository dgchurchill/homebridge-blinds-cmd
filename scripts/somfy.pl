# Example Somfy Control Script.
#
# This assumes that we are talking to a Somfy URTSI transmitter (https://www.somfysystems.com/products/1810872/universal-rts-interface)
# that is attached to an iTach Flex (https://www.globalcache.com/products/flex/) via serial.
# This enables access to multiple Somfy shades via Wi-Fi in a scriptable manner.
#
# URTSI channels allow you to control up to 8 shade systems:
#   1 - Shade or Shade Group A
#   2 - Shade or Shade Group B
#   3 - Shade or Shade Group C
#   4 - Shade or Shade Group D
#   5 - Shade or Shade Group E
#   6 - Shade or Shade Group F
#   7 - Shade or Shade Group G
#   8 - Shade or Shade Group H
#
# Example commands for your Homebridge config.json with homebridge-blinds-cmd:
#
#   "up": "~/path/to/somfy.pl 3 up repeat",
#   "down": "~/path/to/somfy.pl 3 down repeat",
#   "state": "~/path/to/somfy.pl 3 status"
